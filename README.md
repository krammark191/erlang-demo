# Overview

This software is a simple syntax sampler for the Erlang language. I included basic syntax for variables, functions, lambdas, pattern matching, atoms, lists, list comprehension, etc.

My purpose for writing this software was to demonstrate my learning of the Erlang language. This simple syntax sampler helped me to learn the basics of Erlang so that hopefully I should be comfortable using it in the future.
